# Radar Documentation

This repo is the usual *gh-pages* repository that contains the documentation for Radar.  

The public URL for Radar documentation is http://radar.zendesk.com

On the RHS of that page, there is a Table Of Contents that lists the various documentation pages, as well as a link to the full source code for this documentation repo, and a separate link to the main Radar source repo.

As part of the documentation repo there is an *examples* directory that contains the server-side code discussed in the tutorial, as well as the main client-side code.

Code snippets not contained in the repo are clearly listed in the tutorial proper.
