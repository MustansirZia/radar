# Radar Tutorial Examples

## How to get started with the Radar Tutorial

o First, create a local git repo directory, whose name is in RADAR_SOURCE. Issue the following commands:

% cd $RADAR_SOURCE

% git clone git@github.com:zendesk/radar.git .

% git checkout gh-pages

o Once you are looking at gh-pages, you will see the *examples* directory, under which are the three sub-directories listed below:


## example_1/

The files in this directory represent the code and discussion in Step 1 of the
tutorial.

Read SETUP.txt for detailed instructions.


## example_2/

The files in this directory represent the code and discussion in Step 2 and
Step 3 of the tutorial.

Read SETUP.txt for detailed instructions.


## example_3/

Steps 4 through 6 are conducted from the tutorial itself; there isn't any
change to the server-side code for these steps.

example_3 adds *type configuration* code to server.js for Step 7.

Step 8 describes how to use *presence*, and for this no additional server-side
code is required.
