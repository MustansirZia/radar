0.  Prerequisite:

    You have already run through *example_1* in its entirety.

********************************************************************************

1.  Make sure you are in the example_2 sub-directory, and that you have the files
    you need:

      o Files already copied from the radar git repo when working on example_1

      o Files created when working on example_1 that you now copy to example_2

        % cp ../example_1/package.json .


2.  Install *radar_client* from NPM (which updates package.json):

      % npm install --save radar
      % npm install --save radar_client


3.  The local directory

      $RADAR_RUN/examples/example_2/public


    already exists, and the *Makefile* in this directory is used to create a
    current version of *radar_client.js*:

      % make build
    
    
    radar_client.js is the implementation of radar_client that is used by our
    minimal UI:

      $RADAR_RUN/examples/example_2/public/index.html


4.  Verify that the code in *server.js* runs

      % node ./server.js
      Server listening on localhost: 8000


5.  In your browser, enter the following URL:

      http://localhost:8000


    and you should see

        Open the developer console...


    on the screen.


6.  When you have gotten this far without error, example_2 has completed
    successfully.
